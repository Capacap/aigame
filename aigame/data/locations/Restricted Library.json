    "name": "Restricted Library",
    "description": "A dimly lit section of the grand library, filled with ancient tomes and forbidden texts. Tall shelves stretch toward vaulted ceilings, and the air smells of old parchment and dust. A heavy oak desk sits at the entrance, guarded by an imposing librarian who watches every movement with hawk-like intensity. Candlelight flickers across leather-bound spines, casting dancing shadows between the stacks."
