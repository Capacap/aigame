    "name": "Restricted Library",
    "description": "Fortress of forbidden knowledge where institutional authority reigns supreme and every interaction is scrutinized. The formal, intimidating atmosphere demands respect for protocol and hierarchy, making direct confrontation futile but rewarding those who understand proper academic etiquette. The guardian's position of absolute control means traditional bargaining tactics fail - success requires either impeccable credentials, genuine scholarly passion, or discovering the keeper's hidden vulnerabilities. The sacred nature of the texts creates moral weight around any transaction, where appeals to knowledge preservation and scholarly duty carry more influence than material offers. The isolated, controlled environment means privacy for sensitive negotiations, but also eliminates escape routes if discussions turn hostile."
