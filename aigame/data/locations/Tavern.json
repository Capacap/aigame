    "name": "Tavern",
    "description": "A warm, bustling tavern filled with the sounds of conversation, clinking mugs, and crackling fire. Wooden tables are scattered throughout the room, some occupied by locals sharing stories over ale, others by travelers like yourself seeking rest and information. The air is thick with the aroma of roasted meat and bread. Flickering candlelight creates intimate pockets of shadow and warmth, perfect for private conversations. A hooded figure sits alone in a corner booth, their eyes occasionally glancing your way."
