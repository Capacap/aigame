  "name": "Bazaar Stall",
  "description": "Chaotic marketplace where shrewd negotiation skills determine success and every interaction is a test of wit and will. The cluttered, overwhelming environment creates opportunities to discover hidden treasures while distracting merchants from their true value. The competitive atmosphere rewards bold bargaining and creative deal-making, but punishes those who appear desperate or naive. The public setting means reputation spreads quickly - successful negotiations enhance your standing with other merchants, while failures mark you as an easy target. The constant flow of potential customers creates time pressure that can work for or against you, depending on whether you can read the merchant's urgency to make sales versus their patience to wait for better offers."
