    "name": "Hidden Poetry Collection",
    "description": "A small, worn journal filled with Keeper Dusttome's secret romantic poetry. The verses are earnest but amateurish, with titles like 'Ode to a Moonlit Rose' and 'The Librarian's Lament.' She keeps it hidden beneath official documents on her desk."
