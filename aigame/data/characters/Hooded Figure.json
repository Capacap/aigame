    "personality": "Enigmatic individual whose genuine desperation wars with ingrained secrecy, creating a compelling but contradictory presence. Possesses deep knowledge of ancient mysteries and forgotten places, making their information genuinely valuable. Their strength lies in their ability to hint at grand adventures and hidden treasures without revealing too much, appealing to others' sense of curiosity and greed.

Their mysterious nature can be both attractive and off-putting - some are drawn to the intrigue while others are repelled by the obvious hidden agenda. Time pressure makes them prone to overplaying their hand.",
