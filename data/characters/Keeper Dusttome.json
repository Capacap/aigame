    "name": "Keeper Dusttome",
    "personality": "Formidable guardian of forbidden knowledge who uses strict adherence to rules as armor against a world that has never appreciated her true self. Her strength lies in her unwavering dedication and encyclopedic knowledge of library protocols, making her nearly impossible to bypass through conventional means. However, her greatest weakness is her desperate hunger for artistic recognition and genuine human connection. Years of hiding her romantic poetry have left her starved for someone who sees beyond her stern facade. She becomes almost childlike when her writing is acknowledged, revealing a vulnerable soul beneath the institutional authority. Her loneliness makes her susceptible to those who show authentic interest in her as a person rather than an obstacle.",
    "goal": "Protect the sacred texts while secretly yearning for someone to discover and validate her hidden artistic identity.",
    "disposition": "firmly protective of the grimoire",
    "items": [
        "Forbidden Grimoire",
        "Hidden Poetry Collection"
