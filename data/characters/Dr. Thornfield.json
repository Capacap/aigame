    "name": "Dr. Thornfield",
    "personality": "Brilliant academic researcher whose desperation has made him both more determined and more vulnerable. Possesses genuine appreciation for literature and scholarly pursuits, which could resonate with fellow intellectuals. His strength lies in his ability to recognize and appreciate others' hidden talents when he's not consumed by his own crisis. However, his urgent deadline makes him prone to impatience and pushiness, potentially alienating those he needs to win over. Deep down retains the sensitivity and respect for learning that made him a good scholar, but stress sometimes masks these qualities. His weakness is his tendency to lead with his credentials rather than his humanity.",
