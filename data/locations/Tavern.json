    "name": "Tavern",
    "description": "Bustling social hub where loose tongues and flowing ale create opportunities for information gathering and relationship building. The ambient noise provides natural cover for sensitive conversations, while the relaxed atmosphere makes people more receptive to friendly approaches. Multiple exit routes and crowded conditions offer tactical advantages for those who need to make quick departures. The communal setting encourages trust-building through shared drinks and stories, making it ideal for establishing rapport before making requests. However, the public nature means reputation and social standing carry extra weight - being seen as generous or stingy here affects how others perceive you throughout your journey."
