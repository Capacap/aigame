# AI Text Adventure Game Framework

This project is a Python-based framework for creating and playing text-based adventure games driven by Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Overview

The game allows players to interact with non-player characters (NPCs) and the game world through natural language. The NPCs' responses and behaviors are generated by an LLM, providing dynamic and engaging gameplay. The framework supports:

*   Character loading from JSON files.
*   Item management and interaction.
*   Location definitions.
*   Scenario-based gameplay with defined victory conditions.
*   An AI Game Master for evaluating victory conditions and providing narrative.

## Status

**This project is currently a work in progress.** Features, code structure, and data formats are subject to significant change as development continues.

## Running the Game

1.  Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
2.  Install the necessary dependencies using the `requirements.txt` file:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  Set up your LLM API key. The game uses `litellm`, which supports various providers. You might need to set an environment variable (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`) or configure `litellm` as per its documentation.
4.  Navigate to the project's root directory (`aigame`).
5.  Run the main script:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
    You will be prompted to select a scenario to play.

## Project Structure

*   `main.py`: Main entry point for the game. Handles scenario selection and initializes the game loop.
*   `aigame/aigame_core/`: Contains the core game logic modules:
    *   `game_loop.py`: Manages the main game interaction flow.
    *   `character.py`: Defines NPC and player character logic.
    *   `item.py`: Defines item properties and behavior.
    *   `location.py`: Defines game locations.
    *   `scenario.py`: Defines scenario structure and loading.
    *   `player.py`: Defines the player class.
    *   `game_master.py`: Defines the AI Game Master for narrative and evaluation.
*   `aigame/data/`: Contains JSON data files for game entities:
    *   `characters/`: JSON files for character definitions.
    *   `items/`: JSON files for item definitions.
    *   `locations/`: JSON files for location definitions.
    *   `scenarios/`: JSON files for scenario definitions.
*   `venv/`: Python virtual environment (if used).
*   `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python package dependencies for the project.
